This is a small work of mine that uses Deep Learning to capture and recognize facial patterns to detect Human Emotions.

The Model is trained with approximately 30,000 images of human faces that correspond to emotions like Anger, Fear, Happy, Sad etc. The dataset (or the zip file of data) is downloaded from Kaggle. The model used for this detection is 'MobileNetV2', a pre-trained model developed by Google which already has pre-trained parameters/coefficeints which has hepled this model to reach further accuracy. 

Since there is a lack of a dedicated Graphics card, hence there has been very less GPU utilization involved. Thus training of the model has been possible only at about 30-40 epochs alltogether. The accuracy has touched 70%.
